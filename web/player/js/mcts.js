/* PUCT MCTS over cloned Azul states — a port of ludometer/train/mcts.py.
 *
 * Same search as the trained agent plays with, down to the constants: edge stats
 * `(N, W, P)` live in the parent, a simulation descends by maximising
 * `Q + c_puct * P * sqrt(Nparent + 1) / (1 + N)`, expands one leaf, evaluates it
 * with the net and backs the value up.
 *
 * Perspectives. Azul does not strictly alternate — the holder of the first-player
 * marker starts the next round, so the same player can move twice in a row across
 * a round boundary. Values are therefore propagated in *player 0's* frame (`v0`)
 * and converted per node from `node.player`; nothing here assumes alternation.
 *
 * Chance nodes. Inside a round Azul is deterministic; the only chance event is the
 * refill triggered by the move that takes the last tiles. Those edges are handled
 * exactly as Python does — by re-sampled determinizations: clone the parent,
 * reseed and **reshuffle the clone's bag**, apply the move, and file the result in
 * a per-edge table keyed by the post-refill factory/center contents. Reshuffling
 * is what stops the search peeking at the pre-shuffled deal (bag *counts* are
 * public, the order is not). Past `chanceChildren` distinct outcomes a traversal
 * reuses a stored one at random, so the subtree stays deep while the edge's Q
 * remains an average over sampled refills.
 *
 * The one real difference from Python: evaluation is asynchronous, because
 * onnxruntime-web's `run` is. Each simulation therefore awaits at most one
 * inference (batch of 1), and the loop yields to the event loop periodically so a
 * worker can still answer messages. Dirichlet noise is not ported — it only ever
 * applies to self-play training, never to a game against a human.
 *
 * Batching (`config.batch > 1`). A profile of a 5 s think said 92 % of it is
 * spent inside one `session.run` per simulation — the search itself, cloning and
 * legal-move generation included, is 2 %. The only way to buy more positions is
 * therefore to put more of them in each forward pass, which is what `_collect`
 * does: descend `batch` times, each descent laying down a **virtual loss** on the
 * edges it walks so the next one is pushed elsewhere, evaluate the whole leaf set
 * in one dispatch, then back the real values up and take the virtual loss off
 * again. Because the virtual loss is added and removed in the same units it is
 * exact bookkeeping: a finished batch leaves the tree in the state the same
 * sequence of leaf evaluations would have left it in sequentially. `batch = 1`
 * takes the original code path, untouched.
 *
 * The margin head (`config.margin`). If the loaded net has a third output the
 * search also averages it up the tree, in player 0's frame like the value, and
 * the *root* move is then chosen lexicographically: among the moves whose win-Q
 * is within `marginEpsilon` of the best, play the one with the largest expected
 * score gap. A two-output net has no margin at all and keeps the old rule
 * (most-visited child), bit for bit.
